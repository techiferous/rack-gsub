              What my associate is trying to say is that our new brake pads are really cool.
              You're not even gonna believe it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like, um, let's say you're driving along
              the road, with your family.<br />
              And you're driving along...la de da...woo...<br />
              And then all of a sudden
              there's a truck tire
              in the middle of the road
              and you hit the brakes.<br />
              Screeeee!
            </p>
            <p>
              Woah, that was close.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now let's see what happens when you're
              driving with "the other guy's brake pads".
            </p>
            <p>
              You're driving along,<br />
              you're driving along,<br />
              and all of a sudden your kids are
              yelling from the back seat:<br />
              "I gotta go to the bathroom, daddy!"<br />
              "Not now, dammit!"<br />
              "Truck tire! I can't stop! Aaaaa! Help!"<br />
              "There's a cliff! Aaaaa!"<br />
              And your family screaming:<br />
              "Oh my God, we're burning alive!"<br />
              "No! I can't feel my legs!"<br />
              Here comes the meat-wagon! Woo woo woo!<br />
              And the medic gets out and says:<br />
              "Oh! My! God!"<br />
              New guy's in the corner puking his guts out:<br />
              Blllleeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaah!<br />
              Blllleeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaah!<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              All because you wanna save a coupla extra pennies.

              Hey guys, do i look different now that i'm a college grad?
            </p>
            <p>
              Apparently they give a lot fewer D+'s than D-'s.
              It's not a grade they like to give out, i'll tell ya that right now.
