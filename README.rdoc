= Rack::Gsub

== Description

This is a Rack middleware wrapper for gsub. You can replace text on your
web page without worrying about accidentally modifying the HTML tags
themselves.

== Usage

This will replace all occurrences of "five" with "three" and will remove all
occurrences of "the":

  use Rack::Gsub, "five" => "three", "the" => ""

This is the syntax for using within Rails' config/environment.rb:

  config.middleware.use Rack::Gsub, "five" => "three", "the" => ""

== Details

You can use regular expressions, too, just like with Ruby's gsub:

  use Rack::Gsub, /five/ => "5"
  use Rack::Gsub, /f\w+e/ => "5"

By default, the arguments are case-sensitive.  Use the /i regex switch to
do a case-insensitive replace:

  use Rack::Gsub, /five/i => "5"

Only text within the body of the document is replaced.  The following will
only replace the word "five" in the body, not in the page's title:

  use Rack::Gsub, "five" => "5"

Rack::Gsub does not replace the text inside form elements.

Rack::Gsub eventually passes the arguments to Ruby's String.gsub method,
so it behaves the same way.

  use Rack::Gsub, /five/ => "5"
  # gets turned into
  string.gsub(/five/, "5")
